# CryptoClustering or Cryptocurrency Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction Analysis
# Project Overview
This project focused on clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means and optimizing the clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The process included determining the best value for k, clustering the data based on original and PCA-reduced features, and using multiple visualization techniques to compare the results.

## Steps and Key Techniques:
**1. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data**
    - The elbow method was implemented to find the optimal value for k within the range of 1 to 11.
    - A line chart plotted the inertia values to visually identify the best k.
    - After analysis, the best value for k was determined.

**2. Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means Using the Original Data**
     - A K-means model was initialized with four clusters using the optimal k value.
     - The model was fitted using the original cryptocurrency data, predicting the clusters for each currency.
     - The predicted clusters were added to a copy of the original data.
     - An hvPlot scatter plot was created, visualizing clusters based on price_change_percentage_24h and price_change_percentage_7d, with cryptocurrencies identifiable through hover interactions.

**3. Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
    - PCA was used to reduce the dataset to three principal components.
    - The explained variance was calculated to determine the amount of information captured by each component, with the total variance also analyzed.
    - A new DataFrame containing the PCA data was created and used for further analysis.

**4. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data**
    - The elbow method was applied to the PCA-reduced data, identifying the best k within the same range.
    - A line chart was plotted for inertia values, and the best k for PCA-reduced data was compared to the original data.

**5. Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means Using PCA Data**
    - A K-means model was applied to the PCA data using the best k value.
    - The resulting clusters were visualized through hvPlot, comparing PC1 and PC2 values and adding cryptocurrency names for hover interactions.

**6. Visualize and Compare the Results** 
    - Composite plots were created using hvPlot to compare elbow curves and cluster groupings from both the original and PCA-reduced data.
    - The impact of using fewer features (PCA) was visually analyzed, revealing key differences in cluster formation.

**7. Additional Analysis Techniques** 
    - Used t-SNE for advanced visualization.
    - Generated correlation matrices and heatmaps to explore relationships between features.
    - Visualized data with a variety of plots, including a catplot to show outliers and box plots to highlight variance.
    
**8. Code Organization and Submission**
    - All code followed Python conventions, with imports placed at the top and functions/variables named appropriately.
    - DRY principles were adhered to, creating reusable and concise code.
    - The repository contains a Resources folder for the dataset.
    - The Jupyter notebook outside the folder provides detailed insights into the analysis, with appropriate commit messages for all files.
    
## Repository Structure:
  - The dataset is stored in a Resources folder.
  - The Jupyter Notebook includes explanations and visualizations of the entire analysis process.
